Software Test Automation &amp; QA

<ins>**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**</ins> <br> <br>
Utilizing the right testing methodologies for my project is the first step. Unit testing and integration testing are vital components of any project. Adhering to secure coding principles to avoid common vulnerabilities and errors is another great step. Validating inputs and encrypting sensitive data goes a long way. 
Even simple things like keeping your code clear, and well-commented, and utilizing white space can improve functionality and security. This also makes code reviews that much easier. You must review your code for anything that might hinder functionality or security.

<ins>**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**</ins> <br><br>
You can interpret user needs and incorporate them by creating a strong set of requirements. Using these requirements you can create predefined test cases to ensure your program meets those requirements. Whether these test cases pass or fail, and how they fail will tell you if your program meets user needs. 
Alternatively, it tells you what you need to do or fix to ensure your program does.

<ins>**How do I approach designing software?**</ins> <br><br>
Software is meant to fulfill a need or to do a job someone doesn't want to or can't do themselves. When approaching designing software you need to ask yourself a series of questions. What is the need/job that needs to be fulfilled? What is the purpose of this job and why does it need to be fulfilled? What is the best and most efficient way to do this job? What is the most secure way to do this job? How can I make the user experience as pleasant and intuitive as possible? After you answer those questions you can begin to make a strong set of requirements and build a development cycle and system model that allows all of those requirements to be met.
